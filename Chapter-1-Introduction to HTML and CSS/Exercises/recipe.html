          Marinate the chicken pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red
          chili powder, turmeric powder, biryani masala, salt, and half of the
          chopped mint and coriander leaves. Let it marinate for at least 1
          hour.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat oil or ghee in a pan and fry the sliced onions until golden
          brown. Remove and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the same pan, add the whole spices and saut√© for a minute. Then
          add the marinated chicken pieces and cook until they are partially
          cooked.
        </li>
        <li>
          Layer the partially cooked chicken with soaked basmati rice, fried
          onions, chopped tomatoes, green chilies, and the remaining mint and
          coriander leaves. Repeat the layers if needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cover the pan with a tight lid and cook on low heat for about 20-25
          minutes or until the rice is fully cooked and the chicken is tender.
